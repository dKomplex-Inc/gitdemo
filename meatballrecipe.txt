Ingredients

Meatballs
===============================
1 cup stale Italian bread
½ cup milk
½ small onion fine dice
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
2 eggs
¼ bunch Italian parsley chopped
2 cloves garlic minced
2 teaspoons sea salt
1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ cup grated Romano cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil to fry meatballs

Tomato Sauce
===============================
2 cloves fresh garlic chopped
56 ounces Crushed Tomato San Marzano
1 bunch fresh basil
½ onion finely diced
¼ cup Olive Oil
2 teaspoons sugar
Sea Salt and Pepper to taste
2 pounds spaghetti

Instructions

Meatballs
================================
Soak bread in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.
Mix beef and pork together in a large bowl. Stir onions, bread mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper,dried basil, and Romano cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.
Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 ½ inches in diameter.
Heat about ¼-inch of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the meatballs until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 15 minutes.

Tomato Sauce
================================
In a large skillet or small sauce pot, sauté diced onion and chopped garlic in olive oil until onions are translucent, do not allow them to burn!
Add crushed tomatoes, rinse cans with just a little water and add to the sauce (if crushed tomatoes are not available use whole tomatoes and crush by hand or with an immersion blender).
add chopped basil, sugar, sea salt and black pepper to taste (don’t over season you can always add more later).
After your sauce has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low, a simmer for 15-20 minutes for classical Marinara / simmer for 1-3 hours for a rich hearty Tomato Sauce.
Gently add the browned meatballs to the sauce about one hour before you're done cooking the tomato sauce. Don't be tempted to leave the meatballs in the sauce for the entire process, they will get dry and tough.
